My name is Sam Leathers. I live in central Pennsylvania and have a lovely wife and
son and two dogs. My passion is automating technology. I currently work for
AppliedTrust doing automation and deployment. I've shared some of the blog posts
I've done over the past few years on this site.

I also host the State College DevOps meetup. Here's a list of presentations I've
done:

In my spare time, I like to play with technology. Some current projects I'm working
on are:

* Raspberry Pi Car running NixOS deployed via NixOps
* apu.2c4 NixOS based router
* This website (written using nix and built using styx)
* Arduino quad-copter
* Automating outlets using rasperry pi, rf transmitter/receiver and some electric timers with rf remotes
* Wireguard site-to-multi-site vpn between my house, in-laws, parents and my cloud servers

Outside of tech, I have a passion for woodworking, altough I haven't had much time
lately to pursue it. When my son was born, I built a crib out of rough sawn red
oak lumber. My next woodworking project will be to build a standing desk for the office.
